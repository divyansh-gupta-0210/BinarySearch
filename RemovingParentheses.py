# Given a string of parentheses s, return the minimum number of parentheses to be removed to make the string balanced.

# Constraints

# n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of s
# Example 1
# Input
# s = "()())()"
# Output
# 1
# Explanation
# We can remove the ")" at index 4 to make it balanced.

# Example 2
# Input
# s = ")("
# Output
# 2
# Explanation
# We must remove all the parentheses.
