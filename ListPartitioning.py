# List Partitioning
# Given a list of strings strs, containing the strings "red", "green" and "blue", partition the list so that the red come before green, which come before blue.

# This should be done in \mathcal{O}(n)O(n) time.

# Bonus: Can you do it in \mathcal{O}(1)O(1) space? That is, can you do it by only rearranging the list (i.e. without creating any new strings)?

# Constraints

# n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of strs.
# Example 1
# Input
# strs = ["green", "blue", "red", "red"]
# Output
# ["red", "red", "green", "blue"]
