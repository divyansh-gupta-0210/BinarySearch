# Given a singly linked list node, replace every node's value with the first greater node's value to its right. If a node doesn't have a next greater node, set its value to 0.

# Constraints

# n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the number of nodes in node
# Example 1
# Input
# node = [3, 2, 4, 5]
# Output
# [4, 4, 5, 0]

# Example 2
# Input
# node = [1, 1, 1, 1]
# Output
# [0, 0, 0, 0]
